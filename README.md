# Project 2 -- Brewery App
## by Jordan Bortner and Corey Loftus


### Description
What does it do?
    Our Brewery App utilizes the [Open Brewery DB] (http://openbrewerydb.org 'Open Brewery DB') to create a search engine that populates detailed results, and displays a map of where the brewery is.

Motivation for it?
    We thought it would be fun! And a good challenge to apply our learnings about React.
    We're completing this as part of General Assembly's Software Engineering Intensive 10-31-22.

    Corey's brother initially suggested a project like this as part of his strategy for interviewing software engineer candidates. Jordan and Corey thought it would be fun to solve this challenge as part of a project for their Software Engineering Intensive through General Assembly.
    

What problems does it solve?
    - Presents JSON data at a glance for users to locate closest/nearest brewery to them.
    - Presents contact information for breweries based on user search.
    - Displays how recently the data has been updated for each brewery.
