## Action Plan for Development

### Mon Dec 5
- create dummy search results page
- create dummy brewery page
- setup general styling

### Tues Dec 6
- fetching API data

#### What is MVP?
- clickable links to different pages (via navbar and on pages themselves)
- search by zip only
- dynamic content (not static placeholder text)

#### Stretch Goals
- display Map for brewery
- search by string (or any other piece of relevant data)
- user can submit new brewery (object to the array)
- submitting missing data (page that displays all breweries with a value of a key:value pair that === null)
